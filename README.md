# ðŸ“Œ Some tips to add your algorithm to the repository: âœ¨
1. Check if your code is already present in the library.
2. If it is present then please don't add your code. If you could make the existing code better, then go ahead.
3. Follow the [camelCase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel_case) naming convention for source files.
4. If you want to make a folder, please keep the first letter of the folder name capitalised.
5. Add your code to the proper folder.
